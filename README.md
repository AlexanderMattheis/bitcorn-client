# BITCORN
This repository contains a website I've formerly created to test out the Ember Framework
and modern webpage implementations. The idea now is to create a platform for interactive, 
free video-tutorials using YouTube.

On that website you can also download creations like vector-graphics,
fonts and textures. Everything is free, so you have not to pay any licence fees. 
Even you have not to mention the author's name because everything 
except the logos were released under the [CC0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

**Hint:** You need [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/) to transpile and work with the page.
